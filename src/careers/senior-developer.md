* Is comfortable working in a fast-paced and dynamic environment, and have the ability to independently manage a workload with multiple priorities

## You'll love working here with:

* A proud B-Corp organisation that cares about how it behaves inside and out
* Team lunches, drinks and company-wide events
* 14 weeks’ paid parental leave for all genders and a generous parental superannuation package, Employee Assistance Program (EAP), formal training and development with continuous improvement opportunities, a continuous supply of healthy office snacks (if/when you’re in the office) and membership to Bicycle NSW  (or your State’s equivalent) as part of our sustainable transport policy
* Future Super is an equal opportunity employer – we provide flexible working hours, the option to work from home and a laptop you can use to work remotely (this used to be a more differentiating dot-point, but it’s still true!)
