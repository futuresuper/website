An Account-Based Pension is a simple, single account for those who have met a condition of release and will no longer be making contributions to their super. You can receive flexible payments (subject to age-based minimums) on a timeline that suits you, and make lump sum withdrawals at any time.

Please read our [Product Disclosure Statement](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/pppds) and [other important documents](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/forms-and-documents) before deciding to open a pension fund.
