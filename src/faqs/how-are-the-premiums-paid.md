Insurance premiums are deducted monthly (in arrears) from the balance of your super. The premiums will be deducted automatically once your cover commences.

Standard cover commences on the later of the date your opt-in request is accepted by the Insurer and the date when your first super contribution (rollover, employer SG contribution or personal contribution) has been received by the Future Super.

For more information, please see our [Insurance Guide](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/insuranceguide).
