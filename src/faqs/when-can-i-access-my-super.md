Super is intended to fund your retirement, so you can generally only access it once you have retired from working and have met a condition of release. To satisfy a condition of release you will need to meet one of the following:

*   Reach [preservation age](https://futuresuper.groovehq.com/help/what-is-my-preservation-age) and retire permanently from the workforce
*   Leave your employer after turning 60
*   Be 65 or older

There are some additional conditions that allow for [early release of super](https://futuresuper.groovehq.com/help/can-i-access-my-super-early).
