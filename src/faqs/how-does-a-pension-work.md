A Future Super pension account allows you to draw a regular income from your retirement savings while investing them in line with your values.

You can choose to get monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or annual payments and you can usually choose how much you receive (within the mandated minimums outlined in the [Pension Product Disclosure Statement](https://www.myfuturesuper.com.au/pppds)).
