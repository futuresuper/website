You can apply for cover for the following types of insurance: \n\n*   Death\n*   Death & TPD, and\n*   Income Protection\n\nDeath and Death & TPD cover helps provide you or your dependents (as applicable) with a lump sum payment in the event that you die, suffer a terminal illness, or you become totally and permanently disabled (where you have Death and TPD cover). \n\nIncome Protection cover helps protect your income in the event you become partially disabled, totally disabled and a sickness or injury causes you to be unable to work and earn an income. \n\nPlease read more about our insurance offerings and its terms and conditions by accessing our [Insurance Guide](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/insuranceguide), [Product Disclosure Statement](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/pds), [Additional Information Booklet](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/aib) and [Financial Services Guide](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/fsg).\n\nWhen you first join Future Super you have 60 days to apply for our Easy Opt-In Default insurance via your [Online Member Portal](https://portal.myfuturesuper.com.au/member/login_1). This option is only available for Death and Death & TPD cover. This will provide a default amount of cover based on your age and type of work (see pages 17-22 of the [Insurance Guide](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/insuranceguide) for more information). Please note, you will be required to have a balance first, before your Easy Opt-in Insurance begins. If your 60 days have expired, or if you wish to apply for Income Protection, get in touch with us at [info@futuresuper.com.au](mailto:info@futuresuper.com.au) and our friendly team will help you organise a quote!  \n\nIf you currently hold insurance with a different super fund, you may be eligible to transfer your cover.
