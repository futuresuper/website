Your Employer will be able to make Superannuation Guarantee (SG) contributions into your super fund for as long as you remain working and earn more than $450 (before tax) per month.

If you are between 65 - 74 years old and wish to make additional voluntary contributions, you will need to satisfy the [**work test**](https://futuresuper.groovehq.com/help/what-is-the-work-test) or [**work test exemption**](https://futuresuper.groovehq.com/help/what-is-the-work-test-exemption).

_Note - For the 2020-21 financial year onwards, this applies if you are 67â€“74 years old._
