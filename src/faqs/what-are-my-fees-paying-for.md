Fees pay for things like establishing and administering your account, investing your money, running our tech systems, and our wonderful Member Advocacy team.\n\nOur members pay **direct fees** (also known as **dollar-based fees**), and **percentage-based fees**. All of our investment options have a direct administration fee of $1.80 per week, and percentage-based administration and investment fees, indirect costs and buy-sell spreads, that vary depending on which investment option you are invested in. Information about these fees is published on our website under each investment option, and on the [investment option overview page](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/investment-options).\n\nIndividual members may also pay direct activity fees, such as insurance premiums, if they elect to take up an optional benefit provided by the Fund, such as life insurance.Â \n\nOur members are the most important thing to us, and, as such, it is our intention to reduce our fees over time and as we grow.\n\nFor a detailed breakdown of fees, how we apply them and more information on our services, please read the [Product Disclosure Statement](https://futuresuper.com.au/pds), [Additional Information Booklet](https://futuresuper.com.au/aib) and the [Financial Services Guide](https://futuresuper.com.au/fsg).\n"
