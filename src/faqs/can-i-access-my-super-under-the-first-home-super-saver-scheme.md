We do participate in the First Home Super Saver Scheme. This means that voluntary contributions made after 1 July 2017 may be released from 1 July 2018. Members can save up to $15,000 per year in this way and can withdraw a maximum of $30,000.

You can make personal contributions by arranging a salary sacrifice arrangement with your employer, or by making personal contributions via your member portal. Please note that the amount you are eligible to withdraw is assessed by the ATO and any questions about applying for FHSS should be directed to them. 

Please see [this link](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals/super/withdrawing-and-using-your-super/first-home-super-saver-scheme/) to the ATO's website for more information.  

Please note, Super Guarantee (SG), Spouse Contributions and Government co-contributions cannot be released under this scheme.
