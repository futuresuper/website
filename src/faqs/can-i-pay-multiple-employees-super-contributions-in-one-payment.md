If you are paying the contributions directly to us, please submit one [Notice of Payment form](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/employer-notice-of-payment) for each employee.\n\nIf you are paying via a clearing house, you just need to send the contribution information for all your employees together with your electronic payment to the clearing house, and the clearing house does the rest.\n"
