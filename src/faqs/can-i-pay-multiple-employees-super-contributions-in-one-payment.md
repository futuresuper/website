Yes, however this varies depending on how you make your payment.

If you make the payment via BPAY, we will require all the correct remittance information to be submitted electronically in order to be able to correctly allocate the funds to each person. If you are paying the contributions directly to us, please submit one [Notice of Payment form](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/employer-notice-of-payment) for each employee.

If you are paying via a clearing house, you just need to send the contribution information for all your employees together with your electronic payment to the clearing house, and the clearing house does the rest.
