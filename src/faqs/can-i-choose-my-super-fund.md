title: Can I choose my super fund?
category: Superannuation basics
---

Most people have the option of choosing their own super fund. All you need to do is [provide your employer with the details of your preferred super fund](https://futuresuper.groovehq.com/help/how-do-i-get-my-employer-to-pay-to-future-super). If you donâ€™t specify a super fund, your employer will likely create an account for you with their default super fund.

A small number of people are not eligible to choose their super fund, due to Enterprise Agreements with industry funds.

You will need to speak to your employer to find out if this is your situation.
