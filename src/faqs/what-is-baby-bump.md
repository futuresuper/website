Baby Bump is a refund of all or part of the annual dollar-based administration fee, for the time you’re on parental leave, up to a maximum of 12 months ($93.60).

We created Baby Bump for two reasons:

*   Employers don't have to pay super when you take parental leave, and;
*   Dads are less likely to take parental leave than mums.

These two factors contribute to the startling gender inequality in super - that, on average, women retire with 42%\* less super than men. So Baby Bump is Future Super’s baby step towards making super more fair for our members.

For more information on eligibility and how to apply please see this [page](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/baby-bump/).
