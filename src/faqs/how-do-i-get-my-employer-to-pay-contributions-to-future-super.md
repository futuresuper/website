When you join Future Super we’ll send you an email which you can forward to your employer. It will have all the details to help them make payments to your account.

If you’re already a member and have just switched jobs, simply pass on our [Standard Choice Form](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/standardchoiceform) and [General Compliance Certificate](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/generalcompliancecertificate), and direct them to our [Employer Hub](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/employers).

They may need our USI (45 960 194 277 010), ABN (45 960 194 277) and your member number to pay super contributions to your account.
