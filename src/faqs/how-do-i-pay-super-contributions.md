Some payroll systems cover both information and payments, but some cover information only and you may need to pay super contributions to each super fund separately. Even if you are already paying super contributions by EFT or BPAY, you may not be reporting your SuperStream data electronically in a standard format.\n\nYou can use the ATO’s [SuperStream certified product register](https://softwaredevelopers.ato.gov.au/SuperStream-certifiedproductregister) to check if your payroll software is compliant or find another SuperStream compliant solution. \n\nThe ATO also has a handy [Step-by-Step Guide](https://www.ato.gov.au/super/superstream/employers/employer-checklist--a-step-by-step-guide/) for ensuring you are paying super contributions compliantly.\n"
