To be able to pay super contributions on your behalf, your employer may ask you to provide a letter from us stating that we are a complying fund and that we can accept employer contributions. This document is also known as the General Compliance Certificate. 

Our [General Compliance Certificate](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/generalcompliancecertificate) contains all the fund details which your employer may need to set up superannuation contribution payments. 

This certificate can be found on the [Forms](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/forms-and-documents) page and on the [Employer](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/employers) section of our website.
