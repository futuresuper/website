**Employer Superannuation Guarantee (SG) contributions** are presently 10% of a person’s ordinary time earnings (subject to a maximum dollar limit).

Some employers pay more than the minimum 10% but it's not allowable for employers to pay less than this. 

You can read more about employer contributions [here](https://moneysmart.gov.au/grow-your-super/super-contributions).
