**Non-concessional contributions**

Non-concessional contributions are able to be made to your account from your after-tax income and are not taxed when entering the fund.Â 

There is a non-concessional contribution cap of $100,000 per financial year. You can read more [here](https://www.ato.gov.au/super/self-managed-super-funds/contributions-and-rollovers/contribution-caps/).

**Concessional contributions**

Concessional contributions are taxed at a 15% rate and are made to your account from pre-tax income. These contributions include those made by employers from your pre-tax income and self-employed people who may wish to make contributions from their pre-tax income and claim a tax deduction for those contributions. Members of other types of employment can also make personal concessional contributions.

The general concessional contributions cap is $25,000 per financial year. You can read more [here](https://www.ato.gov.au/super/self-managed-super-funds/contributions-and-rollovers/contribution-caps/).
