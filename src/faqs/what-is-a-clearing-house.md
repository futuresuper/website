A superannuation clearing house is an electronic gateway that allows you to make all your super contributions for all your employees in one single payment. Using a clearing house is a [SuperStream compliant way](https://www.ato.gov.au/Super/SuperStream/Employers/Are-you-paying-the-SuperStream-way-/) to pay super contributions. 

The ATO’s [SuperStream certified product register](https://softwaredevelopers.ato.gov.au/SuperStream-certifiedproductregister) contains a list of commercial clearing houses available.

Alternatively, if you have 19 or fewer employees, or a turnover of less than $10 million a year, you can use the free [Small Business Superannuation Clearing House (SBSCH)](https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Super-for-employers/Paying-super-contributions/Small-Business-Superannuation-Clearing-House/).
