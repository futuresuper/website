Using a clearing house is a [SuperStream compliant way](https://www.ato.gov.au/Super/SuperStream/Employers/Are-you-paying-the-SuperStream-way-/) to pay super contributions. \n\nThe ATO’s [SuperStream certified product register](https://softwaredevelopers.ato.gov.au/SuperStream-certifiedproductregister) contains a list of commercial clearing houses available.\n\nAlternatively, if you have 19 or fewer employees, or a turnover of less than $10 million a year, you can use the free [Small Business Superannuation Clearing House (SBSCH)](https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Super-for-employers/Paying-super-contributions/Small-Business-Superannuation-Clearing-House/).\n\n`Source: Australian Taxation Office, YouTube`\n\nRead more about how to access the Small Business Super Clearing House (SBSCH) Service on the ATO website [here](https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Super-for-employers/In-detail/Small-Business-Superannuation-Clearing-House/Accessing-the-SBSCH-service/). \n\nPlease check out our [Employers page](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/employers) to access our clearing house details.\n"
