If you have made an error and require a refund for overpaid contributions, we will require a valid **hardcopy** statutory declaration containing:

*   The member’s name and member number
*   Details of the original payment, including contribution type
*   Brief explanation of the error
*   The amount to be refunded
*   The bank details for refund payment 

Please post your completed statutory declaration to: 

Future Super  
PO Box 1282  
Albury NSW 2640

Please note that we cannot refund these payments without receiving a valid statutory declaration.
