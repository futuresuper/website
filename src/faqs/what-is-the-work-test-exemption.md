From 2020-21 financial year onwards, this will apply for people between 67-74 years old. \n\nThe [**work test exemption**](https://www.ato.gov.au/Definitions/?anchor=WorkTestExemption#WorkTestExemption) allows you to make voluntary contributions for an additional 12-month period from the end of the financial year in which you last met the work test. The work test exemption applies if your super balance is less than $300,000. \n\nYou cannot have relied on the work test exemption in a previous financial year.\n"
