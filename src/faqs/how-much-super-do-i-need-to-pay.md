Generally, Australian employers are required by Government legislation to make superannuation contributions for employees who are paid $450 or more before tax in a calendar month.  It doesn’t matter whether the employee is full time, part time or casual, or if they are a temporary resident of Australia.

The minimum you must pay is called the Super Guarantee (SG) and this is currently 10% of the employee’s wages. 

You can read more about how much super you need to pay on the ATO website [here](https://www.ato.gov.au/business/super-for-employers/how-much-to-pay/).
