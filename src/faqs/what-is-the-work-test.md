You may be required to satisfy the **work test** if you are between 65-74 years old and wish to make additional contributions to your super. From 2020-21 financial year onwards, this will apply for people between 67-74 years old. 

#### Work test

The [work test](https://www.ato.gov.au/Definitions/?anchor=WorkTest#WorkTest) requires you to be gainfully employed for at least 40 hours during a consecutive 30-day period during each financial year in which the contributions are made.

If you meet the work test, you can make the following types of contributions:

*   Voluntary contributions paid by your employer, such as salary sacrifice contributions
*   Personal contributions made by you
*   Contributions made by someone other than you, such as your spouse.

If you do not satisfy the work test you may still be able to make additional contributions to your super if you meet the [**work test exemption**](https://futuresuper.groovehq.com/help/what-is-the-work-test-exemption).
