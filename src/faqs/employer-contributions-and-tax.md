These are called **Employer Superannuation Guarantee (SG) contributions**.\n\nGenerally, you’re entitled to super guarantee contributions from your employer if you’re 18 years old or over and earn more than $450 (before tax) per month. It doesn’t matter whether you’re full time, part time or casual, or if you’re a temporary resident of Australia.\n\nIf you’re under 18 years old, you must work more than 30 hours per week to be entitled to super contributions.\n\nIf you're a contractor, you may still be entitled to super from your employer. You can read more about super contributions for contractors [here](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Super/Getting-your-super-started/Contractors/).\n\nYour employer’s super contributions may be shown on your payslip but often employers will transfer this money to your super fund every 3 months.\n\nMany people have multiple accounts, so it is important to tell your employer about your Future Super account if you want your employer’s contributions to be invested with us on your behalf.\n\nContributions made by your employer (including salary sacrifice) are taxed at 15%. As this rate is lower than most people’s marginal income tax rate, these contributions are called **Concessional Contributions**.\n\nRead more about contributions tax [here](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Super/Growing-your-super/Adding-to-your-super/Tax-on-contributions/).\n"
