If you don't know your Tax File Number, you might be able to find it by:

*   Looking at your income tax notice of assessment or other letters from the ATO
*   Looking at a payment summary (provided by your employer)
*   If you have a myGov account linked to the ATO, you can access your TFN online

If you still can't find it, phone the ATO on 13 28 61, 8.00am to 6.00pm, Monday to Friday.
