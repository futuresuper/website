The super contributions your employer makes from your before-tax income ([concessional contributions](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Super/In-detail/Growing-your-super/Super-contributions---too-much-can-mean-extra-tax/?page=2#Concessional_contributions)) are taxed at 15% by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). 

This tax component is displayed in your transaction history as 'Contributions Tax' and is sent to the ATO by Future Super regularly.  

Note - If you exceed the concessional contributions cap of $25,000 in a financial year, the excess will be taxed at the top marginal tax rate. Read more about excess contributions tax [here](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Super/In-detail/Growing-your-super/Super-contributions---too-much-can-mean-extra-tax/?anchor=Your_age_and_super_contributions_caps#Your_age_and_super_contributions_caps).

The super contributions you make after-tax ([non-concessional](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Super/In-detail/Growing-your-super/Super-contributions---too-much-can-mean-extra-tax/?page=3#Non_concessional_contributions)) are not subject to tax unless you exceed the cap of $100,000 in a financial year. If you exceed the cap the excess will be taxed at the top marginal tax rate.
