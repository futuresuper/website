No. You will only need confirmation that your personal contribution and your [Notice of intent to claim or vary a deduction for personal super contributions](https://www.ato.gov.au/uploadedFiles/Content/SPR/downloads/n71121-11-2014_js33406_w.pdf) has been applied to your account.

You may wish to consult the ATO, an accountant or a financial advisor for appropriate advice on completing your tax return.
