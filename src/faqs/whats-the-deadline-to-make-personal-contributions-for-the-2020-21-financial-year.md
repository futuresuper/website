If you intend to make a personal contribution and have this included in your contributions cap for the 2020/2021 financial year, you will need to do so **before 5pm on the 25th of June**, to ensure it reaches your account in time.

If you miss the deadline, we can’t guarantee that the contribution will be processed in time to be included in your contributions cap for the 2020/2021 financial year. You can contact us at [info@futuresuper.com.au](mailto:info@futuresuper.com.au) or 1300 658 422 for further assistance.
