Divestment serves two purposes. Firstly, divestment delegitimises those businesses that use the power of money to cause harm. For example, in countries where the fossil fuel industry has a firm hold on all parts of society (through political lobbying, the funding of policy think tanks, etc.), divestment erodes the industry's dominance and creates the space needed for change to happen.

Secondly, divestment is most effective when coupled with _re-investment._ At Future Super, it is our mission to ensure that our membersâ€™ money is building a future worth retiring into. By allowing our members to invest in line with their values, Future Super aims to fast track the transition away from coal and into a future free from climate change and inequality.
