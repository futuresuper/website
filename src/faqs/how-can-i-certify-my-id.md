To certify your ID, you will need to scan and print a copy of photo ID, like your passport or drivers licence. You will then need to get the copy certified by an authorised person.

Please see the following list of people who can certify your ID:

*   Police Officer
*   A Registered Justice of the Peace
*   A permanent Postal Services Officer with 2 or more years of continuous service who is employed in an office supplying postal services to the public
*   An authorised representative of an Australian financial services license having 2 or more years of continuous service with one or more licensees
*   A member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia, CPA Australia or the National Institute of Accountants with 2 or more years of continuous membership
*   A registrar or a deputy registrar of a court
*   A Notary Public Officer or a Commissioner of Declarations

You must have the copy of your identification document(s) certified as being **a true copy** **of the original** document(s). The person who is authorised to certify documents must sight the original and the copy to make sure both documents are identical, then make sure all pages have been certified as true copies by writing or stamping 'certified true copy of the original' followed by their **signature, printed name, occupation, contact number and date.** 

Please also note the certification has to be on the same page as the copy of the document, for example it cannot be on the back of the document.
