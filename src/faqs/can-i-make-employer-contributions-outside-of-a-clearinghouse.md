In the event that you can't make a payment to your employee through a clearinghouse, you can submit an employer contribution using direct deposit and our payment confirmation form. Follow these steps:

1.  Contact us at [info@futuresuper.com.au](mailto:info@futuresuper.com.au)Â and request our direct deposit bank details to make your employer contribution to.
2.  Fill in our [Notice of Payment form](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/employer-notice-of-payment) with the details of the contribution.
3.  Make a payment of the same amount as on the form to the account provided. Please also ensure the same payment reference is used.
