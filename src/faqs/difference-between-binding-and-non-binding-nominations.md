A binding death benefit nomination is a written direction made by you to the Trustee that sets out the dependants and/or legal personal representative, as decided by you, who are to receive your benefit in the event of your death. So long as the binding death benefit nomination is valid, the Trustee is bound to follow it.

A non-binding death benefit nomination is a written request made by you that suggests to the Trustee the beneficiaries that may receive your benefit in the event of your death. The Trustee has the final say as to who should receive your death benefits. The Trustee will consider your nomination but is not bound to follow it. The Trustee has the discretion to pay to any one or more of your dependant(s) or legal personal representative(s) or a combination of both.
