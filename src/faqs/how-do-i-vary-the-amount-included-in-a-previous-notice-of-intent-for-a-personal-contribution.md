If you want to increase the amount you intend to claim as a deduction, you can do so provided you haven’t completed the tax return for the financial year in which you have made your contributions. You will need to lodge a second notice specifying the additional amount you wish to claim. For question 10 of the [Notice of intent to claim or vary a deduction for personal super contributions form](http://www.ato.gov.au/uploadedFiles/Content/SPR/downloads/n71121-11-2014_js33406_w.pdf), ‘Is this varying an earlier notice?’ in section C, please place an ‘X’ in the ‘No’ box. 

If you want to reduce the amount you intend to claim as a deduction, you will need to lodge a variation to your original notice of intent sent to us. The variation replaces a previous valid notice and shows the amount of the contributions which you now want to claim as a tax deduction. For question 10 of the [form](http://www.ato.gov.au/uploadedFiles/Content/SPR/downloads/n71121-11-2014_js33406_w.pdf) ‘Is this notice varying an earlier notice?’ in section C, place an ‘X’ in the ‘Yes’ box. 

Please note that you can only vary a previous valid notice if we hold the full contribution covered by the previous valid notice, and you are still a member of the fund. We are not able to amend your notice for any contributions made to any previous super fund prior to rolling over your funds with us.
