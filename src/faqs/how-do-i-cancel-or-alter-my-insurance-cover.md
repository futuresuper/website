We require written confirmation for all cancellations. You can, at any time, cancel your cover by writing to us at [info@futuresuper.com.au](mailto:info@futuresuper.com.au) and we will send you a confirmation letter when your insurance cover is ceased.

We also require written confirmation if you would like to decrease your cover amount. You can, at any time, decrease your cover by writing to us at [info@myfuturesuper.com.au](mailto:info@futuresuper.com.au) and we will send you a confirmation letter when your new insurance cover is confirmed.

If you would like to increase your cover amount, you will be required to go through the underwriting process. You can send us an email at [info@futuresuper.com.au](mailto:info@futuresuper.com.au) to obtain a quote or an application form.
