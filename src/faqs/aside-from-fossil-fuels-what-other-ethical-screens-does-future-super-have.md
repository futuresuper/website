We take a wholistic approach to investing that covers a wide range of ethical issues. We do not invest in companies or activities that cause social or environmental harm, such as detention centres, live animal export, tobacco, and armaments, to name a few. This is known as ‘negatively screening’ companies.

Further to this, we also seek out positive investments in industries that provide benefits for the environment, society and the economy. These investments include renewable energy and energy efficiency, water and resource conservation, healthcare, education, electric transport, green infrastructure and more. This is called ‘positive screening.’

Money is powerful, and we believe that applying both negative and positive ethical screens to the assets we consider investing in will provide us with an investment portfolio that will build a world free from climate change and inequality.
