You can see our [strict ethical screens here](https://www.myfuturesuper.com.au/choosing/ethicalscreens). \n\nFirst, out with the bad: our negative screen rules out harmful and destructive industries like fossil fuels, detention centres, live animal export, nuclear, tobacco and more.\n\nSecond, in with the good: our positive screen ensures we actively seek out companies that are doing social and environmental good, such as renewable energy, healthcare, education and IT. You can view a full list of the companies we invest in [here](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/how-we-invest). \n\nFinally, our team look for positive industries like solar farms and other impact investments to add to the portfolio. Our renewable energy portfolio includes the Bald Hills Wind Farm in Victoria and the Lake Bonney battery in South Australia.\n"
