You can make a transfer from another super fund before you commence taking income payments from your Future Super Pension Plan. The best way to do this is by providing your rollover details on the online pension application form. You can also do this by completing the Rollover Form. Once you are receiving an income from your Future Super Pension Plan, you are unable to make additional rollovers to your account.
