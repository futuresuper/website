You can make a personal contribution before you commence taking income payments from your Future Super Pension Plan. Once you are receiving an income from your Future Super Pension Plan, you are unable to make additional contributions to your account. If you are making a self-employed concessional contribution (before-tax), you must also complete the [Notice of intent to claim or vary a deduction for personal super contributions form](https://www.ato.gov.au/Forms/Notice-of-intent-to-claim-or-vary-a-deduction-for-personal-super-contributions/) and send it to us with your Personal Contribution Form.
