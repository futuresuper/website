## Super for impact

Investing is an opportunity cost. For every dollar in fossil fuels and other harmful industries, you miss a chance to invest in infrastructure and technology of the future.

We don’t just invest responsibly and sustainably - we invest for impact.

Today, we build funds with zero exposure to fossil fuels, negative carbon footprints and direct investments in clean energy projects.

## Our people

Our team is defined by diversity, inclusion and commitment to climate action and equality. Want to help us change the world?
