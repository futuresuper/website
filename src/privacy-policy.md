a privacy policy. This privacy policy sets out the way in which we collect and handle personal information.

We may amend or update this policy from time to time. If this happens, we will keep you posted via our
website. If you do not agree with the changes, you must cease accessing the website. If you continue to
access or use the website after the changes come into effect, we will assume that you have agreed to
them.

## What we do

The Future Super website collects data in order to provide services to you. This includes:

  information, in particular via the use of cookies. Cookies are small data files transferred onto
  computers or devices by websites which tell us when you visit our website, the pages you

  you can easily continue your browsing session when you return to our website. Acceptance
  of these cookies is required in order to use the website. The website also collects technical

  provider, hardware configuration, software configuration, country of origin), or associated
  with the website (such as log and history of all data exchanges, log and history of
  connections);

  data includes information about your identity such as full name and email address, details of
  products or services which we have provided to you or about which you have enquired and
  information contained in any communications between you and us; and
- (c) ​**Behavioural data** ​– the website automatically collects behavioural data, including but not
  limited to data on location, device (phone, tablet or computer) and usage.

## How we use your data

activities and provide you with the platform services.

We use personal information for several other related purposes, including:

## Protecting your privacy

We take all reasonable steps to protect your personal information from misuse, interference and loss as
well as from unauthorised access, modification and disclosure. We:

- only store your personal information on computer systems located in Australia;
- ensure that access to these systems is highly restricted and controlled;
- implement organisational, physical and logical security measures;
- use strong encryption to protect data communications between the platform services;
- encrypt data traffic via the Internet between the website and the systems; and
- limit access to your data so that only staff who require your information to perform a specific
  task or function are able to access your personal information.

Future Super employees must abide by this privacy policy and are kept up-to-date on security practices.

Although we take appropriate measures to keep your data secure, it is your responsibility to assist in
preventing unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information. This may include security on
your personal devices to restrict unauthorised access to your personal information. For this reason we
cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.

In the event of any data breach, we will follow the specific requirements of the *​Privacy Act 1988*​ and the
_Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Act 2017 (Cth)​_ and notify you and other affected
individuals as appropriate.

Note however, that your use of an Internet Service Provider (ISP) will be subject to the separately
provided terms of use of such services. In particular, note that any data processing and/or transmission
of data by the ISP are outside the scope of this policy and not the responsibility of Future Super.

## Links to third party websites

Our website may contain links to other websites, apps and platforms operated by third parties.

Those links are provided for convenience and may not remain current or be maintained. Unless stated
otherwise, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of, or any content on, those linked websites,
and have no control over or rights in those linked websites.

The privacy policies that apply to third parties' websites may differ substantially from this policy, so we
encourage you to read those privacy policies before using those websites.

## Deleting your data

Future Super will only keep your personal information about you for as long as is necessary for the
purposes of the website, or as required by law. When your personal information is no longer needed for
the purpose for which it was collected, we will take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently
de-identify it.

## Data breaches

We are required by the *​Privacy Act 1988*​ to notify you and the Office of the Australian Information
Commissioner in the event of a serious data breach, for example if a database containing personal
information is hacked or personal information is mistakenly provided to the wrong person.

Our notification to you will be sent as soon as practicable and will contain:

- a description of the data breach;
- the kinds of information concerned; and
