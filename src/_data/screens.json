However, when it comes to agriculture and food supply chains, we consider our members’ consumption habits and the current lack of comparable alternative options for feeding our population. The complexity of this situation means we don't take the approach of divesting from all animal agriculture, only from companies that fail our animal cruelty screen. However, we do use our power as a fund manager to advocate for companies to manage animal welfare and climate risks in a meaningful way.
