Nearly $10 of every $100 you earn is sent to a super fund, which invests it on your behalf. Unfortunately, the super industry makes it almost impossible to uncover the real-world companies that get access to your hard-earned savings. **‍**

**SuperSnooper is a tool of discovery.** It was created to help you find out if your super is exposed to morally bankrupt industries like fossil fuels, gambling and weapons. Because you deserve to know.

Help! I don’t want nasty super...
---------------------------------

If you’re reading this, chances are you’ve just searched **SuperSnooper** and found out that your super fund is making some ethically-dubious investments on your behalf.

It’s OK to be cranky - it’s not your fault that super funds keep this stuff out of the spotlight. But now you know, there’s two main actions you can take.  

### 1\. Petition for change

Contact your current fund and give them a piece of your mind.

Send your current super fund an email, or give them a call. Ask if they’re investing your savings in the harmful industries identified by the SuperSnooper tool.

A few things to be aware of:

*   Super funds usually only release the largest 10 or 20 companies in their portfolio (but they’re investing your money, so you should ask questions and demand answers)
*   You can expect to wait at least 4-6 weeks for an email reply. But don’t let that stop you from reaching out.
*   Be nice to the customer service staff - they are just doing their job

Here’s a draft email you can modify and send to your fund.

> Hi,  
> I’m a member of your super fund. I recently discovered that my super could be supporting harmful industries like fossil fuels, gambling and weapons.  
>   
> Can you please provide me with a comprehensive list of the companies you’re investing my super in, and tell me why my super is exposed to harmful industries?  
>   
> As someone who cares deeply about a more sustainable and fair future, I would like to know by what process you incorporate ethical considerations into your investment decisions.  
>   
> Kind regards,  
>   
> Your name
