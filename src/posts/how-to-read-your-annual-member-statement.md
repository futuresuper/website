**We know that annual superannuation statements aren’t the easiest things in the world to understand, so we wrote this handy blog article to guide you through.**

#### Opening balance

This is the balance you started the financial year with (beginning July 1st 2019).

Balance information.

#### What’s gone in and out

Contributions (like rollovers, government, employer and personal contributions), and returns were **added** to your balance.

What’s gone out was **deducted** (like [taxes on your contributions](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/faqs/why-is-tax-taken-from-my-account), withdrawals, insurance fees and direct fees). Anything in brackets means a deduction or loss.

#### Closing balance

This is the balance at the end of the previous financial year (ending June 30th 2020). _Please note: this is not your current balance._

#### How returns are calculated

Your investment performance is displayed after the percentage-based fees are deducted (more on this below). This also means our [published fund returns](https://www.myfuturesuper.com.au/choosing/performanceandreturns) are shown after those fees are deducted.

Your personal investment performance may differ to the fund performance depending on _when_ you rolled in, and _when_ and _how much_ you contributed.

Investment performance information.

#### The fees you paid

You pay **direct fees** and **percentage-based fees.** Combined they make up the **total fees.**

A **direct fee** is deducted directly from your account and appears in your transaction history.

The **percentage-based fees** are deducted when calculating your investment earnings figure, so they don’t appear in your transaction history. In the statement, they are listed under ‘total of indirect costs of your investment’ and ‘other fees of your investment.'

Fee information.

#### Accessing your super

Your account balance is broken into different components in the ‘Access Your Money’ section.

**Preserved** means you can only withdraw this money if you meet [a condition of release.](https://www.ato.gov.au/super/apra-regulated-funds/paying-benefits/releasing-benefits/conditions-of-release/) **‍**

**Unrestricted preserved** benefits generally stem from employment-related contributions (other than employer contributions) made before 1 July 1999. You can access this component of your super if that employment has terminated.

**Unrestricted non-preserved** means you can withdraw without restriction.
