## Introducing BabyBump

BabyBump is a new program for Future Super members where you receive a refund of the weekly member fee for the time you’re on parental leave, up to a maximum of 12 months.

Why have we introduced BabyBump?

It's our way of making super more fair for parents, and it's a baby step towards addressing some of the structural inequality in the super system.

## Gender Inequality and Super

> At Future Super we’re very aware (and have [written previously](https://www.myfuturesuper.com.au/blog/making-superannuation-just-a-little-more-super-for-women)) of the glaring injustices in our superannuation system that mean women in Australia retire with [47% less super than men](http://makesuperfair.com.au/).

For parents, that gap is even wider, with mothers retiring with a whopping [60% less super than fathers](https://percapita.org.au/research/not-so-super/).



This sobering figure actually **reveals two massive problems in Australia**: the first (and most obvious), is that there is a “[motherhood penalty](https://percapita.org.au/research/not-so-super/)” for women when it comes to superannuation. The second (and more subversive) is that [very few Dads](https://www.wgea.gov.au/sites/default/files/Parental-leave-and-gender-equality.pdf) in Australia are taking parental leave.

## **Future Super’s new BabyBump program is designed to address both of these problems.**

The BabyBump program is a fee rebate for Future Super members of **any gender** who have recently become new parents, whether by birth or adoption. All you need to do is complete [this simple form](https://myfuturesuper.com.au/babybump) and confirm your eligibility, we’ll rebate our membership fee back into your super account for the period that you’re on parental leave (up to $93.60).

> BabyBump is our way of saying CONGRATULATIONS on your new arrival!



...and it’s a baby step we can take towards fixing the structural inequality in the super system for new parents: by **protecting the super for women taking time out of work** to be with their new child, and **removing one of the barriers** that might stop fathers from doing the same.
