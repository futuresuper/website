Future Super talks to companies about their behaviour whether we invest or not. Last year, we engaged 87 of the ASX100 and had 6 companies commit to improvements on their gender equality policies — positive changes that could impact over 8000 employees in Australia.

Influence isn’t only for the uber-wealthy. The collective value of superannuation is 1500 times Clive Palmer's net worth. If he was loud enough to influence the federal election in 2019, imagine what we could do.

As of June 30 this year, Future Super members have moved $658,575,436 of their super dollars toward building a future worth retiring into. That's just over Beyonce's net worth. In her own words, "she's worth every dollar". So is divestment.

In 2019, we used proxy voting to advance the ethical and environmental management of companies we invest in.

Future Super is less than 6 years old, and yet in that amount of time our members have collectively divested $52,481,335.48 from fossil fuels — or just about two times Mark Hamill's net worth. That's right — you could get two Luke Skywalkers for that cash!

In July 2019, we became the first super fund to invest into the National Clean Energy lending market. What does that mean? The platform offers people an alternative to obtaining a bank loan in order to install solar, which means that anyone can finance solar and batteries for their homes at a fair interest rate by accessing the National Clean Energy lending market through the RateSetter platform.
