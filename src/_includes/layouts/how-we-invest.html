        <h2>Impact investing</h2>
        <p>Impact investing is what makes Future Super unique. No other super fund actively seeks investments that
          provide
          the greatest opportunity for your money to make a positive impact.</p>
        <p>We define impact according to our mission, as meaningful systems change leading to a prosperous future free
          from climate change and inequality. </p>
        <p>An impact investment at Future Super must provide financial value to our members and also make a direct
          contribution to action on climate change or inequality. Impact investments make up roughly 10% of all
          investments (by financial value)* made by Future Super.</p>

        <h3>Choosing impact investments</h3>
        <p>Choosing impact investments isn’t a cut-and-dry process. Each opportunity is unique and so we focus on the
          impact objective, or the ability to make a difference. Although that can be anything, there are some
          categories
          we keep a close eye on.</p>
        <p>Many of Future Super’s impact investments involve the creation of new clean energy, while others create the
          infrastructure for a more equal future, like the building of disability housing. </p>
        <p>The point of these investments is to create tangible systems change that may not happen without our
          investment, wherever the opportunity may be.</p>
        <p>We have a framework to help identify these opportunities.</p>
