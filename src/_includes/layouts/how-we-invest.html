        <h2>Impact investing</h2>
        <p>Impact investing is what makes Future Super unique and industry leaders in financial impact. We actively seek
          investments that provide the greatest opportunity for your money to make a positive impact.</p>
        <p>We define impact according to our mission: as meaningful systems change leading to a prosperous future free
          from climate change and inequality. Every dollar invested with Future Super contributes to our impact, but
          impact investments make a significant contribution to our mission in their own right.</p>
        <p>An impact investment at Future Super needs to be able to provide financial value to our members and also make
          a direct contribution to action on climate change or inequality. Impact investments make up roughly 10% of all
          investments (by financial value)<span>*</span> made by Future Super.</p>

        <h3>Choosing impact investments</h3>
        <p>Choosing impact investments isn’t a cut-and-dry process. Each opportunity is unique and so we focus on the
          impact objective, or the ability to make a difference. Although that can be anything, there are some
          categories we keep a close eye on.</p>

        <div class="marquee-container">
          <div class="marquee seek">
            <ul>
              <li>Clean energy transition</li>
              <li>Clean energy transition</li>
              <li>Clean energy transition</li>
              <li>Clean energy transition</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Many of Future Super’s impact investments involve the creation of new clean energy, while others create the
          infrastructure for a more equal future, like the building of disability housing.</p>

        <div class="marquee-container">
          <div class="marquee seek">
            <ul>
              <li>Waste management</li>
              <li>Waste management</li>
              <li>Waste management</li>
              <li>Waste management</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>The point of these investments is to create tangible systems change that may not happen without our
          investment, wherever the opportunity may be.</p>

        <div class="marquee-container">
          <div class="marquee seek">
            <ul>
