Our investment portfolio has been carbon negative since 2018. But our standards aren’t exactly standard. Most businesses don’t even report their climate impact. When they do, there’s no standardised way of calculating carbon. That’s a problem.

We can’t create accountability when 2050 climate targets are managed by CEOs who hold their jobs for just 5 years on average. There is a need for consistent and clear carbon measurements to track progress on business net zero goals.

Our carbon reporting methods can be used by anyone and lay the foundation for a more transparent industry.
