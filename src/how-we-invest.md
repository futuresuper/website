impactInvestingRules:
  - The investment demonstrates a clear impact objective, making a strong case that their actions intentionally contribute to positive change in the world.
  - The money we contribute directly connects to the outcome.
  - The impact is closely aligned to Future Super’s mission to create a future free from climate change and inequality.
  - There are clear stakeholders that benefit from the investment. Extra consideration will be given to underserved stakeholders
  - Impact should be broadly experienced (i.e. by many people) or if only a small group of underserved stakeholders benefit, then the impact must be of particular significance.
  - Investments where our money doesn’t create any benefits (e.g. secondary markets like equities) cannot be considered ‘impact investments’.
  - Investments with high risk of failure will be avoided unless the failure doesn’t result in loss to members and contributes to better knowledge about effective solutions.
  - We take into account a number of additional, more granular, rules that cover topics such as an investment’s finances and its own investments in other companies.
